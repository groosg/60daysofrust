# 60 Days of Rust

This repo keeps track of my learning experience with Rust.

- Day 1: [Development environment with Neovim](./day1/)
- Day 2: [Programming a Guessing Game](./day2/)
- Day 3: [Guessing Game Web](./day3/)

## Bootstrap a day

```shell
day=4; mkdir day${day}; cd $_ && cargo init --vcs none && sed s/{day}/${day}/g ../day_readme_tpl > README.md
```
